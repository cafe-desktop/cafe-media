gvc-sound-them-chooser: Fix CtkComboBox behavior

It reverts mate-media commit:
https://github.com/mate-desktop/mate-media/commit/7b23aad70cb730faabbf867a57b1e8b1618a4cf1

It fixes the issue:
Change sound theme to 'No sounds'
Change sound theme to 'Default'
The CtkComboBox still says 'No sounds', but the expected is 'Default'
